# Credits
I learned how to reverse engineer a bluetooth device thanks to [@urish](https://github.com/urish)! 
In particular I took inspiration from these articles:
- [Reverse Engineering a Bluetooth Lightbulb](https://urish.medium.com/reverse-engineering-a-bluetooth-lightbulb-56580fcb7546)
- [Start Building with Web Bluetooth and Progressive Web Apps](https://urish.medium.com/start-building-with-web-bluetooth-and-progressive-web-apps-6534835959a6)

Without the open source code of [@balda](https://github.com/balda) I would never had properly setup the Dockerfile, I heavily took inspiration from [this repository](https://github.com/balda/ruuvitag-discovery).
